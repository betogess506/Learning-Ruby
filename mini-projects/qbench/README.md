Very simple command line utility for benchmarking code snippits. Will not pass command line arguments to the snippit.

Download the .gem file in the pkg folder, install it locally by using gem install qbench-0.1.0, then run the utility with qbench file-name.rb.

PULL REQUESTS WELCOME! :) Show me things I don't know how to do!
