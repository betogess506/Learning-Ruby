== Welcome to Learning Rails with Richard!

This folder is the working folder while I learn rails with Agile Web Development with Rails 4e. This closely (but not exactly) mirrors the example code, less my own abstractions.

The heroku version is occasionally updated as I go, check the commit history to see as of what commit the site is accute: http://obscure-headland-4219.herokuapp.com/

Criticism/Support welcome!

Cheers!

Richardu
