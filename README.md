Welcome to Learning Ruby with Richard :)
=========================================

I have no idea why you might be here, but if you're here, nice to meet you.

This repo really is nothing more than just the documentation of my efforts while I learn the amazing language that is Ruby. The code is likely not 'perfect' and I have a few mini projects (most coming from the book I'm reading) in the mini projects folder that I might expand on.

The book I'm reading from is called: *[Programming Ruby 1.9](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0)* it is a **FANTASTIC** book, easily one of the best I've read. Go read it if you haven't, I strongly reccomend it.

Background
-------------

By way of background, I'm a business student turned programmer. I've completed 2 years of business school at the University of British Columbia, and dropped out after I discovered my love for programming. I plan to go to BCIT for Computer Systems Technology and Computer Engineering in January. I used to be an avid programmer when I was younger, but somehow my aspirations got distorted away from that. I used to be a half bad C++ coder, spending most of my time playing with the Ogre 3D engine. I'm in serious mode now though, seriously.

I'd love to meet fellow rubyists or find projects I can collaborate on. I REALLY would like to get involved in some open source endeavors. Feel free to give me a shout at r.crawfordwilson@gmail.com

Cheers!
